## Important Note

For the complete and functional operation of the Employee Management System frontend, it is essential to have the corresponding backend system up and running. The frontend interacts with the backend to provide a seamless user experience, allowing users to perform CRUD operations and access various features.

Please ensure that you have the [Employee Management System Backend](https://github.com/RohanWork/employee-management-system-core-backend-1) set up and running on your system before using the frontend. The backend provides the necessary APIs and services to support the frontend's functionality.

If you haven't already, follow the backend's setup and installation instructions in its repository to establish the backend component of the system. Once the backend is operational, you can proceed to run and interact with the frontend as described in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

Your system should have both the frontend and backend components working together to enjoy the full capabilities of the Employee Management System.

## Usage

The frontend component of the Employee Management System serves as the user interface for managing employee data. It offers a straightforward means of interacting with the backend and executing CRUD operations seamlessly.
